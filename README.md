<h1 align="center">Gauss - Seidel</h1>

[Gauss - Seidel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) -> iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations.

Here’s an algorithm in python in which we’ll be able to use Gauss - Seidel to solve a system of linear equations.

It works on python.

Before you run it, you must have numpy installed.

You can do it in your command prompt using

```
pip3 install numpy
```

Also you can do it in Linux Shell

```
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```


Once you have the libraries, you must be able to run the program!

Please be sure to know the theory of Gauss - Seidel first! I personally recomend to work first the equations in paper.
